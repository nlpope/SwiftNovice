# Project Title

SwiftNovice - A bootcamp in your pocket! SwiftNovice guides the user through prerequisite courses that got me to where I am today before providing them a set of real world projects via codementor.io.

## Getting Started (Requires a Mac & iOS device)

1. Download XCode at: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ 

2. Copy the project's clone link: available under button labeled 'Code' above

3. Clone the project in Xcode

4. plug your iphone into your Mac's port

5. At the very top, by the  app's icon and title name select the iphone icon and a list of simulators should appear 

6. In that list, select 'iphone' under the 'Devices' section (should be the only one of it's kind in that section)
  > This sets up your phone as the space the app will run on for the next step

7.WAIT! Before moving on to the next step, be sure to download and run the project in my repo titled "SwiftNoviceServerMk2"

8. Once device is selected, hit cmd + r (or hit the play button at the very top of the navigation bar) to run the app

9. You should see the app's icon appear on your homescreen before it opens automatically

10. Happy learning!
